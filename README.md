digital goldfish

i used this as a sandbox to experiment with claude code.

i've included all my claude relevant files including the plans and `claude.md` used for configuration. 

i used three claude code instances:
1. fish physics
2. RL environment
3. simulation and rendering

i'm quite happy with what it made thus far.
